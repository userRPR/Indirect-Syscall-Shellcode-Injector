# Indirect-Syscall-Shellcode-Injector
Shellcode injector using indirect syscalls, with dynamic SSN and syscall address resolution.

Created this for learning purposes, next step is to either encode shellcode and add decode function or use custom shellcode to enhance AV evasion.

Some resources that I used that were very helpful:
- Theory and the technique to dynamically resolve SSN and syscall address: https://redops.at/en/blog/direct-syscalls-vs-indirect-syscalls
